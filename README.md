# odin-recipes
So this is my first project, with odin, I have a bit of html/css skills (even though I'm not currently using css)
from when I first created a website. However, that first website was mostly me following along a tutorial so I want 
to build myself up to be able to build a website with little help. Currently I know how to create links, lists, paragraphs,
and the very basics of git. I'm still not very sure on when I should commit or not nor do I feel really confident with git but
hopefully that will change with this project, or at the very least get better.
