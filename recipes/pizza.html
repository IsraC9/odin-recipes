        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Dough:</strong></p>
            <li> 1/4 cups warm water</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li> 3 cups of bread flour</li>
            <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons of fine salt</li>
            <li> 1 1/4 cup olive oil, divided</li> 

            <p><strong>Sauce:</strong></p>
            <li> 1 (28 ounce) can plain crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li> 1 (14 ounce) can pizza sauce (such as Don Peppino)</li>

            <p><strong>Cheese:</strong> </p>
            <li> 8 ounces low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li> 
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. 
                Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. 
                Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
            <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. 
                Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. 
                Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
            <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. 
                Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
        </ol>
